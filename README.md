# Survival-Analysis-Heart-Failure-Prediction
Survival Analysis using Kaplan Meier estimator and Cox proportional model

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.

Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Age, serum sodium, serum creatinine, gender, smoking, Blood Pressure (BP), Ejection Fraction (EF), anemia, platelets, Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK) and diabetes were considered as potential variables explaining mortality caused by CHD. Age, serum sodium and CPK are continuous variables whereas EF, serum creatinine and platelets were taken as categorical variables. EF was divided into three levels (i.e. EF≤30, 30<EF≤45 and EF>45) and platelets was also divided into three level on the basis of quartiles. Serum creatinine greater than its normal level (1.5) is an indicator of renal dysfunction. Its effect on mortality was studied as creatinine >1.5 vs ≤1.5
